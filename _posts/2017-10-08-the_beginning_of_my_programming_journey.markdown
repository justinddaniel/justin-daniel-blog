Life offers so many possible paths to take. I myself have considered a ton of different careers and have switched careers mroe than once. My aptitude lies in analytical thinking and brain work; as far back as I can remember puzzle solving, strategy games, learning about science, and other intellectual pursuits have inspired me the most. Software programming thus seems like a natural choice. I tried out writing some code a few months ago as a teacher on summer vacation and I have never looked back. 

So the simplest answer to the question "why did you decide to become a programmer" is that I love programming. But this answer is a necessary but not sufficient piece of the puzzle. I also love writing both fiction and nonfiction, science research, and teaching. The missing piece of the puzzle is this: I decided to become a programmer both because I love programming *and* because the market shows it is so in demand as a service people want. 

We often tell kids "follow your passion" when they are confronted with what career to aim for. If this were all there were to it than video gaming would surely be the most common career. Better advice is "follow your passion that will most serve other people." A career in a nutshell is what you can do for other people. 

So I decided to become a programmer because I love its intellectual labor, it fits my aptitudes, and it is something people want very intensely as a service at the tme of writing. This answer might not be as inspiring as a story about falling passionately in love with the craft and just knowing that it was what I wanted to do. But my answer is more honest and more enlightening.
