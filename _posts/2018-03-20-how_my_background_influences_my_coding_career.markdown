As I prepare to wrap up my final project I am feeling a bit reflective. How did I come to this point? I have spent the past decade pursuing careers that are not directly related to programming. So the obvious question then is how has that influenced me? 

I spent a decade doing science research and teaching at the college and secondary (high school) level. I think that the natural sciences such as biology and chemistry are actually much like programming in some ways. Both deal with modeling causes and effects. As a biology researcher I studied how plant chemical defense affects herbivores and their predators. As a developing programmer I am, at the time of writing, studying how React interacts with Rails backend to affect the user experience. 

I actually like programming better in one respect: it is so much easier to design experiments to test the system. Every time I fire up the React server to see what it renders can be considered an "experiment." I have not mastered writing specific tests yet but they seem much more straightforward than the kinds of scientific experiments I had to devise. 

The natural sciences and information sciences/programming both require abstract thinking. I consider this to be my strongest trait. Both require a certain attentiveness to detail, a drive to innovate, and an appreciation for efficiency. The transition in that respect has been quite natural. 

Teaching and programming seem more disconnected, at least at first. It is true that teaching deals mostly with people, though abstract ideas are also very much a part of it. I think that one of the most valuable crossover skills that teaching has given me, though, is understanding the user experience. Every time I designed an assignment or a lesson plan I had to carefully consider my students/users experience. The same is true with frontend web development. Teaching really helps develop your intuition for how students or users with limited attention spans will interact with your product.

I am currently really enjoying programming and part of me wishes I began this career earlier. On the other hand I have developed a lot of applicable skills from my careers in scientific research and teaching. I am very excited to be at the point of employable for a new career in programming and I can hardly wait to get started!
