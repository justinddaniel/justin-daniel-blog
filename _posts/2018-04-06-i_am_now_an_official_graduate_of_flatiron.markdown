It felt great yesterday to receive official notice that I have graduated the Full Stack Web Development program! I think the biggest emotion I felt was relief: I finally have what I would call a major achievement under my belt as a developer and must admit that such a feeling of validation is needed in my new career. I accomplished plenty as a science teacher and researcher, but now I have something tangible I can point to as a technologist. 

I am continuing to hone my coding as I search for my first developer job. I am helping other Flatiron students, upgrading my apps, doing coding challenges on Code Wars, and reading lots of articles on the programming craft. Last night the moment sunk in most deeply when I was able to add "Flatiron Graduate" to my resume. 

Onward Ho!
