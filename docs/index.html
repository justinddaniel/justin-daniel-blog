<h1> Welcome to my home page! </h1>

<h4> Hello vistitor! You have reached my (Justin Daniel's) professional blog page. Here you will find information about my current projects, technical skills, educational background, thoughts about the tech industry and programming, and whatever else code-related that crosses my mind. I also like to use these pages to test out new formats and ideas as I experiment with the latest developments in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
<br><br>
I have designed this blog to share my knowledge with anybody interested in coding and technology, or who simply wants to know more about me. I share my professional side on this blog and some occasional tidbits about the lighter side of me and my life (all aboveboard and nothing too personal). </h4>
