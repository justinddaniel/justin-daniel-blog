			<p> Justin is a data scientist. His calling is to gather data through research, use these data to build models of how systems work, and then apply this knowledge and teach it to students. His current career emphasis is web and software development: he uses test-driven development to build Internet sites and software that people can use. 

			Justin has worn plenty of hats and has acquired quite a few skills along the way. In the past decade he has been an ecological researcher, a post-secondary and secondary science teacher, and an online technical coach.
