  			<h4> Justin's statement of teaching philosophy </h4>

  			<p> "As a teacher I identify a student's current level of development and create teachable moments and a learning environment to expand that level of development as much as possible. I adhere to the following principles in doing so:" </p>
  				<ul>
  					<li> Listening first, and only later being heard: I make sure I understand a student as an individual and where they are at in their current ability level before I launch into teaching. </li><br>

  					<li> Model-coach-fade: I show students best techniques, then do it with them, then gradually fade so that they can do it independently. I never do for a student what they can do themselves. </li><br>

  					<li> Growth mindset: I do not believe in "constructive criticism" as this has a negative connotation. Instead, I identify "opportunities for improvement." The focus on lessons is honing one's knowledge and craft, not in proving oneself smart. </li><br>

  					<li> Clearly measurable goals: my teaching mimics my programming and science research. I use test-driven development and teaching to ensure students are achieving goals and improving. By "test" I simply mean any good measure of a student's skill and knowledge. Having them talk a concept through can be considered a test. So this is not meant to be stressful, for those with test anxiety! I have found that it is crucial that students and teachers hold themselves accountable and always test themselvs to see how they are progressing. </li><br>

  					<li> Deep learning: I believe that deep learning requires deep thinking. And deep thinking requires a developed abiity to concentrate for long periods of time and engage in metacognition. Metacognition is the ability to think about thinking, and to identify one's own thought patterns. I help students develop this ability. </li><br>
