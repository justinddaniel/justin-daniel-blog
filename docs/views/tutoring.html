  			<h4> Contact Details </h4>

  			<p> Send email to <strong>justinddaniel@gmail.com</strong> Justin checks his email several times a day and thus you will receive a response within 24 hours. Make sure you include the term 'tutoring' or 'lesson' in the subject line so Justin can easily find and catalog your email. Please clearly explain what kind of lesson you are looking for and what your learning needs are. Justin will then set up an initial conference to discuss scheduling and lesson preparation. </p>
